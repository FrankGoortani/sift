## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Working on the Roadmap

- We encourage contributions to the existing list of features in the [Roadmap](#roadmap).
- Before starting work on a feature, please check if it’s already assigned or in progress by someone else.
- If you’d like to work on a feature from the Roadmap, please comment on the corresponding issue or feature request to express your interest. This helps avoid duplication of effort.

### 2. Submitting Feature Requests or Bug Reports

- If you’d like to add a new feature that is not in the Roadmap, or if you find a bug that needs fixing, please submit a **Feature Request** or **Bug Report** first.
- To submit a request:
  - Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/frankgoortani/sift/issues) on GitHub.
  - Clearly describe the feature or bug, its purpose, and how it aligns with the project’s goals.
- Once your submission is reviewed and approved, you can proceed to work on it.

### 3. Creating a Pull Request (PR)

- After your feature request or bug report is approved, create a new branch for your work:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-name
  ```

- Make your changes in your branch, ensuring your code adheres to the project's style guidelines.
- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Update documentation as necessary.
- When ready, push your branch to GitHub:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature-name
  ```

- Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub from your branch to the `main` branch.
- In the PR description, link to the related issue or feature request.
- Your PR will be reviewed by project maintainers, and you may be asked to make additional changes.

### 4. Code Review and Approval

- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one project maintainer before being merged.
- Be open to feedback and willing to make improvements to your code as needed.
- Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
